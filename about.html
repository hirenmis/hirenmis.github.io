<p>  My name is Hiren Mistry, I am currently a 2nd grade teacher in Austin, TX.  I've worked in education for five years and have been a teacher for two years. I've really enjoyed working in elementary education, at that age students ability to think freely and creatively isn't inhibited like it is when they're older. I ultimately learn just as much from them as they do from me.                                                                                                                                         
<br />   It wasn't until we had to switch to virtual learning this past March that I started to consider switching careers. My job went from incorporating some technology into my core instruction to completely relying on technology in every aspect of my job. I became curious as to how certain programs worked and how it could be improved if I could improve it. Which led me to consider learning how to program.</p>
